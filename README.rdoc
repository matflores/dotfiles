= Mat√≠as Flores Dot Files

My config files (bash, vim, git, etc).


== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/matflores/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install

== Features

If you're using Rails, you'll find some handy aliases (below). You can 
also use show_log and hide_log in script/console to show the log inline.
  
  ss       # script/server
  sc       # script/console
  sg       # script/generate
  at       # autotest
  tlog     # tail -f log/development.log
  rst      # touch tmp/restart.txt
  migrate  # rake db:migrate db:test:clone

If there are some shell configuration settings which you want secure or 
specific to one system, place it into a ~/.localrc file. This will be 
loaded automatically if it exists.

== Acknowledgements

The approach I'm using is based on Ryan Bates' work. See http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles.
